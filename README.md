# Campfire

## Built using ASP.NET Core backend and Xamarin.Forms client running SignalR
Real Time Communication or RTC as the cool kids call it has always been a hot topic, especially for mobile. In normal mobile development when we wanted to get updates of data we would make a web request to a server, pull down data, and update our user interface. If you wanted to get bits of data on demand and in real time you would have to integrate WebSockets or some sort of push notifications to receive data as it is happening. However, it doesn't have to be anymore with the latest version of SignalR (ASP.NET Core SignalR) which is fully compatible with .NET Standard 2.0 for ASP.NET, UWP, WPF, WinForms, and Xamarin!
